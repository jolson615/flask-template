# flask template

## Creating a run command

There's a little magic happening here, but it's pretty necessary to create a run command. 

New custom run command:
```bash
cd flask-template
flask run
```

Have the generated preview URL show up in your terminal by using this process:
```bash
http://${server.port.8080}
```
